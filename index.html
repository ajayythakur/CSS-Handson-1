    <ul>
    <li style="color: brown; letter-spacing: 5px">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <span id="c5"><li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li></span>
    <li>
        <span id="c6">
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file. 
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span id="c7">
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However ,<span id="c8">in this tutorial we will use Inline and Internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try yourself.

<p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class  applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<p class="p1">In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style or set of style can be applied to the element.
<p class="p1">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of most commonly used are Class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
